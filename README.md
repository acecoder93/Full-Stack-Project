# Full-Stack-Project

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p> For this full-stack project, our team set a goal to develop a dashboard for users when they visit the web. The purpose of this dashboard was to provide the user with an aesthetic layout for an enjoyable user experience, and provide the functionality of a user to view the news, search for YouTube videos, create a to-do-list, view stock information, and be inspired with a unique quote on a day-to-day basis. The purpose of our dashboard is to centralize information that a user utilizes on a daily basis. This is an all-in-one location for a user to visit.

<h2>Planning</h2>

    <p> When we began planning out the features of what we would like to include in the dashboard, we listed out the requirements of the project. The key task at hand was to utilize an object-relational mapping (ORM) tool in conjunction with a database. This would allow us to store information for users. With that said, we began to sketch the features and tables that would be required to store the data. Since we were developing a landing page, we began to do research of what APIs we could implement. The purpose of this dashboard is to centralize information for a user.
